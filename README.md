# ISPS-VETA Clinical AI Simulation

**ISPS-VETA (Integrated Space Psychiatry System – Virtual Embodiment TeleAvatar)** is a simulation-based clinical AI decision-support prototype designed to support behavioral health triage in isolated, confined, and extreme (I.C.E.) environments.

This repository presents an early-stage **pilot simulation model** for a future clinically supervised support agent within the broader **MAGSBHO QUARTET architecture**.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to explore how a bounded, explainable, simulation-based AI system could support:

- early detection of behavioral or cognitive distress
- triage of support needs
- escalation to human clinicians in higher-risk situations

This repository is intentionally structured as a **simulation pilot only**.

## Important Safety Statement

ISPS-VETA is **not** a diagnostic tool, **not** a replacement for licensed clinicians, and **not** an autonomous clinical system.

All outputs are intended strictly as:

- decision-support signals
- simulation outputs for research exploration
- inputs for future clinician-supervised workflows

Any future real-world deployment would require:

- Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval
- clinician oversight
- formal validation
- medical ethics and safety review

## Relationship to MAGSBHO

ISPS-VETA is being developed as a separate pilot system and is intended to later integrate as the **fourth agent** within the **MAGSBHO QUARTET architecture**.

### MAGSBHO QUARTET Overview
- **KIRK** — Operational and Ethical Governance
- **EVE** — Non-clinical Wellness Support
- **SpaceGuardianGPT (SGG)** — Personal Reflective Support
- **ISPS-VETA** — Clinician-supervised Clinical Support

Together, the QUARTET forms a continuum of care:

**Wellness → Reflection → Ethical Alignment → Clinical Support**

All four agents operate under bounded roles, governance constraints, and human oversight; no single agent acts autonomously in high-risk conditions.

## Pilot Simulation Goal

The initial machine learning pilot tests whether structured behavioral and cognitive indicators can support safe triage decisions under simulated conditions.

### Input Features
- stress
- mood
- sleep quality
- cognitive load
- repeated distress signal
- social withdrawal

### Output Classes
- `ROUTINE_SUPPORT`
- `MONITOR_CLOSELY`
- `ACTIVATE_INTERVENTION`
- `ESCALATE_TO_HUMAN_CLINICIAN`

## Why This Matters

Future long-duration missions and remote austere environments may require systems that can:

- recognize worsening distress early
- preserve human dignity and agency
- remain bounded and interpretable
- escalate uncertainty and risk to human experts

The design philosophy follows a **Do No Harm** principle and aligns with governance-constrained, human-in-the-loop AI safety.

## Machine Learning Pilot

This repository includes a preliminary multi-class machine learning simulation that predicts triage actions from structured scenario data.
The model is evaluated not only for overall performance, but for **safety-relevant behavior**, especially the need to avoid missing high-risk cases.

**ISPS-VETA ML Pilot Results.** Preliminary comparison of machine learning models for simulated clinical triage decisions. Evaluation emphasizes safety-relevant behavior, particularly recall for escalation to a human clinician.

### Safety Principle
In this system, it is more acceptable to over-monitor than to fail to escalate a serious concern.

## Current Status

- simulation-only prototype
- no real patient data
- no diagnostic claims
- early machine learning pilot for triage logic
- designed for future IRB-aligned testing

## Future Work

Planned next steps include:

- expansion of simulated scenario sets
- clinician-guided labeling of risk categories
- temporal modeling of accumulating distress
- integration with behavioral and physiological streams
- formal validation under clinician and IRB oversight
- future integration into the MAGSBHO QUARTET system
